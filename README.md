# Findings

◉ 60% of the kids are female and rest 40% are male in Kherwara District and in Pali District all the kids are Female.

◉ In Kherwara District it is observed that 75% of the children fall within the age group of 11-13 years old and the kids of age group 20-22 years old are even less than 1%.

◉ For Pali District 53% of the kids fall in the age group of 11-13 years old while 23% fall in the age group of 14-16 years old.

◉ Ideally as the age increases their class should also increase but here we can see that it is not the case there are still kids which are of age 14 and 15 years but are still in class 5 this is due to consistency in their education..

◉ As we can see that from every Block almost 68% of the kids are out of School and same is for Clusters.
